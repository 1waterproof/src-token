# SwissRealCoin token

Implementation of SwissRealCoin token is based on Open Zeppelin framework. This is a very early version of the upcoming code which is still in ongoing development by our team.

## Dev

As a developer you steps are:

```
npm install -g truffle
npm init -y
npm install -E zeppelin-solidity

```

Zepelling is installed using `--save-exact` since the framework still does not follow semantical versioning.

In order to compile the contract do:

```
truffle compile
```
